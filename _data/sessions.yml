  title: "Inclusiveness in Open Science"
  description: "Science in the 21st century is becoming increasingly collaborative and open in nature. Consequently, the advancement of a research field should be measured not only by scientific output but also by the level of participation of its community members. Hence, a successful community should be able to promote equal participation from its community members independent of the factors such as geographic location, gender, ethnicity and social background. In my talk I will explore inclusiveness as one of the key features of open source community and share some of the lessons learned while adopting them in my work as a community manager."

  title: "Using open data to track and predict infectious disease"
  description: "As pathogens replicate and spread, their genomes accumulate mutations. Such sequence data are increasingly used to track the spread of pathogens which in turn can inform public health public health interventions. Historically, however, sequencing and analysis has lagged months-to-years behind sample collection. We have developed automated analysis pipelines process openly available sequence data. The results are visualised in an interactive web application <a href='https://nextstrain.org/' target='_blank'>nextstrain.org</a>. Intuitive and interpretable visualizations like nextstrain are key to turn data into actionable results that public health officials can build upon."

  title: "Open Access in Switzerland: The Endgame"
  description: "The high-level goals are set. According to the <a href='https://www.swissuniversities.ch/fileadmin/swissuniversities/Dokumente/Hochschulpolitik/Open_Access/Open_Access_strategy_final_e.pdf' target='_blank'>Swiss National Strategy on Open Access</a>, all scholarly publications funded by public money must be freely accessible on the internet by 2024. The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) even wants to reach <a href='http://www.snf.ch/en/theSNSF/research-policies/open-access/Pages/default.aspx' target='_blank'>100% OA by 2020</a> for all publications that result out of SNSF funded projects. How can these goals be put into practice?"

  title: "Autonomous Scholarly Web"
  description: "In this talk we will discuss the realisation of a social scholarly information space that is completely driven by autonomous and interoperable open Web standards. What are the effects and artefacts of such paradigm? How is it different than the plethora of existing services and platforms? Why would a researcher-centric approach to scholarly communication be desirable?"

  description: "Scholarly communication and the development of open science are currently undergoing a crucial shift: Now that open access is widely recognised and practiced, researchers, libraries and publishers vie for control over digital research infrastructure. New demands for open data and open access compliance from funding instruments add to the complexity of this competition. This talk will sketch out how Switzerlandâ€™s university libraries can contribute open alternatives to prorietary, closed products."

  title: "An Overview of Swiss Open Data"
  description: "The open data movement in Switzerland is active for over eight years now. Community building, data liberation, political lobbying, conferences, open data hackdays (almost 20!) and other activities have been performed by hundreds of open data activists with a lot of success in the last years. However some limitations of open data in Switzerland are obvious: e.g. the lack of a federal open data legislation or the hesitation of most Swiss private companies to join the open data movement. In the short and midterm future open data should play a key role within a developing Swiss data ecosystem where beside open data also personal data will be used under the control of the individual (&#34;my data&#34;) and private sector enterprises will exchange data under restrictive framework conditions (&#34;shared data&#34;)."

  title: "The Global Open Science Hardware Roadmap"
  description: "The ability to use, study, replicate, and improve scientific instrumentation is a central part of experimental science, and plays a crucial role in education, research and action that are all critical to achieving scientific and development goals. However, these activities are currently restricted by proprietary instrumentation, which is difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain, since it cannot be fully inspected, evaluated, or customised. This situation is fundamentally detrimental to the production of knowledge in the global South and the potential for diverse actors to create equitable and sustainable solutions to local and international problems. Open Science Hardware (OScH) is one solution to promoting global access to hardware for science by freely sharing designs and protocols for instrumentation. The Global Open Science Hardware Roadmap is a collaborative community initiative involving 100 contributors from 30 countries that describes what is required for OScH to become ubiquitous by 2025."

  title: "Making Open Science good for scientists"
  description: "Just as the open access movement is forcing the scientific community to reconsider the traditional review/publication process, open data policies are highlighting the inadequacies of how scientific productivity is measured, especially in the context of large science projects. The open science paradigm can be better for both science and scientists, but institutes adopting open data policies must also recognise that doing science is often more than just doing research and publishing papers. Without such changes the (old) arguments for not sharing data to protect the careers of (young) scientists will continue to have weight."
